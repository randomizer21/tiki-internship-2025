To begin your internship, you'll need a working Python environment. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-quick-start?originUrl=%2Fdocs
2. Follow VS Code's python documentation all the way to Environments
    - Pick Python 3.11.x (latest .x is fine)
    - In environments, follow the instructions for Virtual Environment (venv)
3. Write a small python program that take in a name and a last name as args and prints them to the console
    - Make sure that you can place breakpoints in this program
